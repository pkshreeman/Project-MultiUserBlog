## How do I test this locally?
### Python 2.7 is mandatory.
  Not Python 3.x or 2.6 or even 1.0.

If you have latest MacOS, you should have Python 2.7 up and running.  Otherwise, please refer to <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/> for your particular (apparently obsolete) machine to be installed.  If you are not sure, type python -V in your terminal or console to find out.

### You need Google Cloud Tools installed
Follow the instructions given in this link: <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/>


### Clone my repo into your local folder

Go to the level where you can see the app.yaml, and type ```dev_appserver.py app.yaml``` then run over to your favorite browser, presumely the Chrome browser, and type localhost:8080 to view the local app.
